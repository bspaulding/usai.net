This is one of the many reasons why we've continued to work with them and are in the process of rolling out a new hosted co-located environment with them.\r\n\r\nI've been in the industry for about 15 years and have dealt with a lot of different ISP's throughout the country and world.  They are definitely the best ISP to date that I've worked with in service, reliability, and ease of doing business.
